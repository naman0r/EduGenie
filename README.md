- firebase auth (sign in with google popup)
- google calendar auth (OAuth 2 to make the user verify that we can have access to their google calendar)
- Canvas integration: UX design is bad since user has to manually fill out their personal access token from canvas. is there a way around this?
- Resources: Text (MVP ready), mindmaps (MVP pready after some clever prompt engineering and fixing UI/UX), flashcards: Not done.
- Chat feature: able to generate Short videos (around a minute) on any topic the user prompts
- Supabase Schema set up for the future
